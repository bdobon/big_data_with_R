```{r}
source("readDataToMemory.R")
readFootball()

library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)

# HEAD
##print(dbListTables(con))
```

```
select ~ SELECT
filter ~ WHERE
arrange ~ ORDER
summarise ~ aggregators: sum, min, sd, etc.
mutate ~ operators: +, *, log, etc.
```

```{r}
print(dbListTables(sql_con))
```

## Pipes

```{r}
players %>%
  head
```

```{r}
players %>%
  colnames
```

```{r}
players %>%
  sapply(class)
```



## SELECT ~ select

```{r}
players %>%
  head %>%
  select(player_name, birthday)
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT player_name
,   birthday
FROM Player
LIMIT 6
")
```

## WHERE ~ filter

```{r}
players %>%
  filter(birthday >= "1998") %>%
  head
```

## ORDER ~ arrange

```{r}
players %>%
  arrange(birthday) %>%
  head
```

## aggregators ~ summarise

```{r}
players %>%
  summarise(weight=mean(weight), height=mean(height))
```

## mutate

```{r}
players %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight*0.45359237) %>%
  summarise(weight=mean(weight_kg), height=mean(height))
```

*Versió dplyr/SQL*

```{r}
"
SELECT AVG(weight)*0.45359237 AS weight_kg, AVG(height) AS height
FROM Player
" %>%
dbGetQuery(sql_con, .)
```

No ens cal guardar-ho (assignar-ho a cap variable/taula), doncs si ho volem graficar senzillament seguim amb el **pipe**.

## GROUP BY

```{r}
players %>%
  mutate(year=as.numeric(substring(birthday, 1, 4))) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(height=mean(height)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, height)) +
  geom_line(colour="darkorange") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Observem que canvia molt al llarg dels anys, això és degut a que per alguns anys tenim mostres molt petites, doncs, ho acotem.

```{r}
players %>%
  mutate(year=as.numeric(substring(birthday, 1, 4))) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(nsample=n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, nsample)) +
  geom_line(colour="darkorange") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
players %>%
  mutate(year=as.numeric(substring(birthday, 1, 4))) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(height=mean(height), nsamples=n()) %>%
  filter(nsamples >= 200) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, height)) +
  geom_line(colour="darkorange") +
  theme_minimal()
```

*Versió SQL/dplyr*

```{r}
"
SELECT year, AVG(height) AS height
FROM (SELECT id, SUBSTR(birthday,1,4) AS year FROM Player) AS a LEFT JOIN Player AS b ON a.id=b.id
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year ASC
" %>%
dbGetQuery(sql_con, .) %>%
ggplot(.,aes(year, height, group=1)) +
geom_line(colour="darkorange") +
theme_minimal()+
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

```{r}
"
SELECT year, COUNT(1) as n_sample
FROM (SELECT id, SUBSTR(birthday,1,4) AS year FROM Player) AS a LEFT JOIN Player AS b ON a.id=b.id
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year ASC
" %>%
dbGetQuery(sql_con, .) %>%
ggplot(.,aes(year, n_sample, group=1)) +
geom_line(colour="darkorange") +
theme_minimal()+
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

```{r}
"
SELECT a.year, height
FROM(
  SELECT year, AVG(height) AS height
  FROM (SELECT id, SUBSTR(birthday,1,4) AS year FROM Player) AS a LEFT JOIN Player AS b ON a.id=b.id
  GROUP BY year
  ORDER BY year ASC
) AS a INNER JOIN (
  SELECT year, COUNT(1) as n_sample
  FROM (SELECT id, SUBSTR(birthday,1,4) AS year FROM Player) AS a LEFT JOIN Player AS b ON a.id=b.id
  GROUP BY year
  HAVING n_sample >=200
  ORDER BY year ASC
) AS b ON a.year=b.year
" %>%
dbGetQuery(sql_con, .) %>%
ggplot(.,aes(year, height, group=1)) +
geom_line(colour="darkorange") +
theme_minimal()+
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

#Exercise

*Translate from SQL to dplyr or from dplyr to SQL*

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT *
FROM Match
LIMIT 6
")

#----------#

"
SELECT *
FROM Match
LIMIT 6
" %>%
dbGetQuery(sql_con,.)

#----------#

games %>%
  head
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT country_id
,   COUNT(1) AS n
FROM Match
GROUP BY country_id
ORDER BY n DESC
")

#----------#

"
SELECT country_id
,   COUNT(1) AS n
FROM Match
GROUP BY country_id
ORDER BY n DESC
" %>%
dbGetQuery(sql_con,.)

#----------#

games %>%
  select(country_id) %>%
  group_by(country_id) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

```{r}
countries
```


```{r}
games %>%
  left_join(countries, by=c("country_id" = "id")) %>%
  select(name, home_team_api_id) %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(teams = n_distinct(home_team_api_id)) %>%
  arrange(desc(teams))

#----------#

"
SELECT name, COUNT(DISTINCT home_team_api_id) as teams
FROM Match AS a LEFT JOIN Country AS b ON a.country_id=b.id
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY teams DESC
" %>%
dbGetQuery(sql_con,.)
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT *
FROM Player_Attributes
LIMIT 6
")

#----------#

players %>%
  head
```

* Who are the players with the higest accuracy?

```{r}
"
SELECT b.player_name, a.avg_accuracy
FROM (
  SELECT player_fifa_api_id AS id, ROUND(AVG(heading_accuracy),2) avg_accuracy
  FROM Player_Attributes
  GROUP BY player_fifa_api_id
  ORDER BY avg_accuracy DESC
  LIMIT 30
) AS a LEFT JOIN
  Player AS b ON a.id=b.player_fifa_api_id
" %>%
  dbGetQuery(sql_con,.)
```

* Where do they come from?

* Add team name and translate to dplyr

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT stage, home_team_goal, home_team_api_id
FROM Match
WHERE country_id = 1
AND season = '2008/2009'
ORDER BY stage
")

#----------#

dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT a.*, team_long_name, team_short_name
FROM (
  SELECT stage, home_team_goal, home_team_api_id
  FROM Match
  WHERE country_id = 1
  AND season = '2008/2009'
  ORDER BY stage
) AS a LEFT JOIN Team AS b
  ON a.home_team_api_id=b.team_api_id
")

#----------#

games %>%
  filter(country_id==1) %>%
  filter(season=='2008/2009') %>%
  left_join(teams, by=c("home_team_api_id" = "team_api_id")) %>%
  select(stage, home_team_goal, home_team_api_id, team_long_name, team_short_name) %>%
  arrange(desc(stage))
```
