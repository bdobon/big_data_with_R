### Order products

`order_products__*.csv`

These files specify which products were purchased in each order.

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sc, "SELECT * FROM order_products__prior_tbl LIMIT 10")
```
 
## orders

`orders.csv`

This file tells to which set (prior, train, test) an order belongs. 


```{r}
orders_prev <- dbGetQuery(sc, "SELECT * FROM orders_tbl LIMIT 100")
orders_prev
```
 
```{r}
dbGetQuery(
  sc,
  "
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_id) AS products
FROM order_products__prior_tbl
  "
  )
```

```{r}
products_popularity_txt <- "
SELECT product_id
,   COUNT(1) AS n_orders
FROM order_products__prior_tbl
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY n_orders DESC
LIMIT 50

products_popularity <-
  dbGetQuery(sc, products_popularity_txt)

## Products

`products.csv`

```{r}

```{r}
dbGetQuery(

## Questions

* For given department, plot the most popular product (with templating department).

Calcula el nombre de productes que hi ha en una cistella de la compra i ho afegeix a cada producte; llavors per cada product_id calcula el nombre mig de productes que hi ha en les cistelles en què és comprat.

*Could modify the query and add product name?*

```{r}

*Product that is usually orders in small baskets*

```{r}

*For the 10 first users and all their orders find the days since first order*

- Days from first to last:

```{r}

- Cummulative sum until each order:

```{r}
